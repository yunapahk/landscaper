# Landscaper

![studio ghibli landscape](https://peakmemory.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cliufqx.jpg)

You'll be creating a simple game using your new language that takes in user input.

#### Learning Objectives

- Putting everything you've learned so far together (arrays, loops, conditionals)

#### Prerequisites

- New Language (arrays, loops, conditionals)

---

## Getting Started

1. Do all your work in the landscaper.py file
2. All the functions needed to get the game to work are documented in the file, they just need you to write the logic described in the comments
3. make sure to install pytest if you haven't already `pip install pytest`
4. As you finish each function run `pytest` to see if the tests are passed
5. to run the game run the play.py file `python play.py`

## Landscaper

1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use battery-powered lawnmower to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500.  You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534;  <b>Commit your work!</b> <br>
    Your commit message should read something like: <br>

    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: user can use a team to cut grass"
    <hr>

1. You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000.  In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, they've won.

    Your commit message should read something like: <br>
    "landscaper: win scenario"
    <hr>


## Deliverables

- The ability to take user input
- The ability for the user to earn money
- The ability to buy tools and use the new tool
- The ability to win the game and end it
    - _Hint:_ Try setting the win amount to $10 first, then $50, and etc. until you get to the end to allow for easier testing!

## Technical Requirements
1. Your landscaper game *must* run on first load with no syntax errors
1. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above it explaining what is wrong

## Hungry for More?

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price
